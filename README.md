# Mini-Social-Network

## Description
This is a mini social media database using mongoDB and mongoose. It has collections for users, thoughts (aka posts) and reactions (aka comments). 
## Installation
Please download this repository from my github.

## Usage
Review the api routes before beginning to use with Insomnia. Once reviewed, you should be able to get, post, put and delete users, thoughts, and reactions(where relevant). There is no front end to this, so the application only works in testing platforms such as Insomnia. The user's collection holds information on the thought's they posted, and for the friends they have.
